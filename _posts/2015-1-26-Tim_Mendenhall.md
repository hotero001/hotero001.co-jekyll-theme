I wrote a partial post yesterday, which will be completed at a later date due to there being a lot of shit on my plate at the moment.
This is another partial post that I will be sure to complete at a later time. I know, this is bad, right? Starting the posts
and leaving them incomplete for the time being is a bad habit, and I promise it will not happen often. However, I got to thinking, and I can not
let this thought go unrecorded. This post is essentially dedicated to my former manager, Tim Mendenhall of Inter-Mountain Labs in Sheridan, Wyoming.
I idolize that man. In this post I will try to accomplish the difficult task of articulating Tim's all-around greatness. I will try to
articulate why I believe that America's greatness is, at its core, attributed to men like Tim Mendenhall. I know that as long as this country is 
populated by great men like Tim Mendenhall, we can be confident about the future of this country. Lastly, I must convey the sorrow I feel as a result
of deciding to leave Inter-Mountain Labs. If I ever have a son, I will name him Tim.
