title: Installing PostgreSQL using Homebrew Guide
---

I spent what I believe to have been too long of a time today trying to install PostgreSQL. After a bit of frustration, 
I came across this article from CodeFellows. I recommend following along with it if you are having difficuty installing
PostgreSQL. If you have some issues installing PostgreSQL, do not feel too bad. My friend is a software developer at a start-up in Seattle, WA and when I spoke to him of my initial difficulties installing PostgreSQL, he shared the difficulties he experienced with it as well.
