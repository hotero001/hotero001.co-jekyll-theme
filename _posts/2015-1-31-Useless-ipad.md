title: Useless Ipad No More
---

I purchased an ipad a little over a year ago. I convinced myself it would be a worthwhile purchase as I could use it for reading ebooks. After a few months I was totally regretting the purchase. I have a Samsung Galaxy, and the screen is more than sufficient in size for reading. I was barely using the ipad, and I was thinking about selling it. Then, something changed. I write code on a 13 inch retina Macbook Pro, and I tend to keep multiple windows open at one time, constantly flipping back and forth. I wished to convert my ipad into a second monitor but I read an overwhelming amount of bad reviews about existing apps that converted your ipad into a second monitor using wi-fi. When the Duet app was released, the reviews were fairly positive, so I decided to give it a try. I love Duet. The only complaint I have about Duet, is that it seems like the image quality is reduced on the ipad when it is being used as a second monitor. I do not watch videos or do anything for leisure when I am hooked up via Duet so I do not really mind the reduced image quality. What I mean by reduced image quality is that the image does not look as sharp; the resolution appears to be degraded if that helps to clarify anything. I do not experience a noticeable lag, and windows can be dragged back and forth without resizing issues. Overall, I would give the app a 4/5. It has given my ipad a purpose in life.
