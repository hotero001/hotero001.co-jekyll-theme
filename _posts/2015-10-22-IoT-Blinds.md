title: IoT Blinds Update
---

A few months ago I had planned to implement IoT functionality into the blinds in my room. I have finally gotten around to partially completing the project. I am now able to open and close my blinds from my macbook pro wherever I have internet access. The reason I say that the project is only partially complete is because 1) It does not look very pretty. The Raspberry Pi is exposed and just lying on the ground. The motor connected to the Raspberry Pi is exposed in the open as well and it is only connected to the blind wand by a clip. The setup is definitely not something I would be proud to sell. However, for my own purposes, it is suitable and I may just leave it as is, since I do not plan on making this a product. 2) I had initially planned to control the blinds' position from a dedicated web app and a dedicated iOS app. I have not gotten around to building either. I control the blinds' position by logging into the Raspberry Pi via SSH from my Macbook and executing a Python program I wrote that then prompts me to spin the motor in one direction or the other. I am still not sure if I will go through the trouble of building a web app and iOS app, simply because it is time consuming and I do not plan on selling this as a product. Overall, I am glad I achieved my initial goal, and it is pretty sweet that I can now open and close my blinds from anywhere in the world as long as I have an internet connection.
