title: Black Hat Mischief
---

I love to play jokes on people, and now that I have dedicated myself to computer programming, it was only a matter of time 
until I began to play harmless jokes on those around me. My brother was the first victim. I hacked into my brother's machine 
by ssh'ing into his machine from my mbp and then running commands from the command line. I made the macbook say things like: "System failure" and 
"Thank  you for choosing Apple". Lastly, I wrote a Ruby program that opens the apple.com/support web page every 20 seconds. It was hilarious. 
I finally confessed it was me after one day of pranking.
