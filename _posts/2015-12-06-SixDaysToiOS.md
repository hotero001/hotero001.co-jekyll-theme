title: 6 Days to iOS
---

Several months ago I dabbled in learning Swift for iOS development. I followed some tutorials online and built some very simple 
apps that I never published. After about a month, I stopped learning Swift for iOS becuase the language turned me off for some reason, 
and I also did not have any app ideas that compelled me enough to go out and build. I have decided to build an iOS app for soccer referees. 
I looked in the applt app store and I noticed there was only one such existing app. It was only available in English and German, and it did not 
have rave reviews. I am going to try to build a better app and build it in English and Spanish. I am going to build it for iOS first, since I have 
an iOS device, and since it will be the first app I intend to publish, I want to go through the entire apple process for familiarity purposes. The 
real intent however, is to publish this app for Apple Watch. The vision for this app is that soccer referees who have an apple watch will use the app 
to record the time and disciplinary info for their games, in lieu of carrying a booklet and pen during each game. Lastly, I plan to have this app submitted 
to the Apple store in six days time. So, the app should be submitted to the app store for review by the end of the day of December 12, 2015. I will add a post 
in the days following my app's submission to the Apple store.
