title: Tealeaf Academy Course 2, week 1 
---

I have just completed the precourse work/week1 of Course 2 in Tealeaf Academy's program.

Up next in week 2 is a focus on Rails forms. To understand forms, we have to put several things together: ActiveRecord models, routing, resources, controllers, view templates, validations, strong parameters. I look forward to learning more.
