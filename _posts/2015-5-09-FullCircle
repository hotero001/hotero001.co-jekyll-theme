I am back in SoCal. Seattle was awesome. I hope to truly call it home someday. I have learned a lot in the past few months. 
I have built Ruby on Rails apps, gone to LA Hacks (where I helped build a facebook app that only displays your messages, friends
online, and upcoming events. We used Facebook's API for the app, I believe the API is closed to the public now), and I have opened 
an LLC in the state of California with my best friend. We are called Larsen & McDermott Enterprises, LLC. We will be building the 
Internet of Things(IoT). I am currently working on the iOS app that will be used to open and close blinds from your phone, from anywhere
 in the world. I am bulding the app using Swift. The blinds will be controlled by a Raspberry Pi that actuates a stepper motor to 
 open or close the blinds. I expect to be done with this first product of ours by June 10, 2015.
