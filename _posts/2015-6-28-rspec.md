I have recently started Tealeaf Academy's 3rd and final course in their Ruby on Rails online bootcamp program. 

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'spec_helper'

describe Category do
  it "saves itself" do
    category = Category.new(name: "comedies")
    category.save
    expect(Category.first).to eq(category)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
