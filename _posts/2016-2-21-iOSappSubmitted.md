title: iOS app Update
---

In my last post, I declared that I was in the process of building my first iOS app for submission to the Apple app store. Somewhat foolishly, 
I wrote that the first version would be submitted to the app store in 6 days. Wow, was my estimation way off. It took me about 45 days to submit 
the app to the store. The app was submitted this past Wednesday and is currently awaiting review. Of course, in the past 45 days, I actually only worked 
on it about every other day. The app is called soccerrefapp, and as the name suggests, it is an app for soccer referees to keep track of their game 
data, such as score, bookings, etc. The most challenging aspect of the development was working with core data for the first time. I plan to submit a more aesthetically 
pleasing version of the app in the future, as well as a version for the Apple Watch, which is the primary device that referees will use the app on. Also of importance, a 
future version will include tests. I did not write tests for the first version of the app (shame on me), but future versions will definitely include 
testing. The app should be available for free in the app store in a few days. I recommend you check it out.
