Hello! My name is Hector. I have a B.S. in Chemical Engineering, and I have spent the past two years working for an Environmental Consulting company based in Sheridan, Wyoming. My duties as an Air Quality Engineer included writing software for Environmental monitoring equipment. Although I had written significant amount of code at University, this was the first time in my life that I was forced to truly dive deep into writing code. At first I did not enjoy it very much because it was very frustrating, but as my skills improved, I fell in love, and I realized the immense power that one can have by leveraging programming. 

This is my blog, which I will dedicate mainly to technical matters (programming & chemical engineering), with an occasional off-topic blog. 

Cheers & thanks for reading!
