Hello! My name is Hector. I am one of the Co-Founders of Larsen & McDermott Enterprises, a California LLC. I have a B.S. in Chemical Engineering, and I have spent the past two years working for an Environmental Consulting company based in Sheridan, Wyoming.

This is my blog, which I will dedicate mainly to technical matters (programming & chemical engineering), with an occasional off-topic blog. 

Cheers & thanks for reading!
